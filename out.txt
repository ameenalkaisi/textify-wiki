Split Shipment
It is not the responsibility of the carrier to determine if a load they are taking is a split shipment. The customs broker or importer should inform the carrier when they are taking a load that is clearing under a split shipment.

The importer or customs broker will also have obtained special permission from the CBP port prior to set up the split shipment PAPS entry.

Crossing Into the U.S. (CBP)
Crossing Into the U.S. (CBP)
In order to cross commercially into the United States, the carrier will need to register with the Department of Transportation where the carrier must get a US DOT or MC number. Once a DOT number has been assigned the carrier must then register their company with National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA.org) to get a valid Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC).

Once the carrier has a valid Standard Carrier Alpha Code the carrier can then move forward in ordering barcode labels and processing ACE electronic manifests.

In order to cross commercially into Canada, the carrier will need to register with the specific provincial transportation authority as a commercial carrier. In Ontario this is done through the Ministry of Transportation with a CVOR or (Commercial Vehicle Operators Registration). Once a carrier and driver is registered with a CVOR, the company will then apply for a Bonded or Non-Bonded Carrier Code with Canada Border Services Agency. This Carrier Code is a 4-character unique company identifier for use with cross-border shipments.

Once the carrier code is valid, the carrier can then create barcode labels and register to process ACI eManifests.

Checking the status of another carrier's PARS. Because CBSA will only send you automatic updates for PARS with your own carrier code, you wouldn't get them when you're hauling freight under another carrier's PARS.
Checking to make sure a PARS was cancelled or no longer on file. Because CBSA only sends updates when a PARS is accepted or released, you will not receive notice when the broker cancels a PARS or changes the cargo control number.
Checking the status of a PARS if you have reason to believe that the status in BorderConnect is not accurate. e.g. recent CBSA downtime may have caused missed messages or a broker's website shows a PARS is already accepted by CBSA, but you do not see it on BorderConnect.



Sending a Status Query
Sending a Status Query
To get started with the status query feature, select the option 'Send New Status Query' from the 'PARS Shipments' menu.





You will now be brought to a screen where you can enter the cargo control number that you want to get the status for. You will want to take care to enter the full number exactly as it appears on the PARS sticker or other document, with no spaces or special characters. Once you have the cargo control number entered, you can simply click the 'Send Status Query Request to CBSA' button.





This will bring you to the Status Query Search Page. This page allows you to see what's going on with all of your recent status queries, and can also be used to look up past status queries using the search feature.

The status query that you just sent will be listed as the first result, and it will say "Status Query Request transmitted with no response." It generally takes about 10-15 minutes for CBSA to respond to a status query, so you may want to leave the page to do something else and return to it later. When leave the page you can return to it at any time by selecting 'Status Query Search' under the 'PARS Shipments' menu.





After 10 or 15 minutes have gone by, you should check back at the search page to see what the response was for your status query. CBSA will respond saying the status is either not on file, accepted or released. In the case of an accepted or released response, the shipment will also appear under 
Newest Shipments
Shipment Search
In the case of a not on file response, the shipment will be marked as purged if it was previously accepted.





Other Ways of Sending a Status Query
Other Ways of Sending a Status Query
1. When sending a status query for a shipment that was previously accepted, a convenient shortcut is to click the View link for that shipment where it is listed under your Accepted Shipments, and then use the Send Status Query button from there. This will fill in the cargo control number for you on the send new status query page, so that you only have to press the send button to send it off.

New In-Bond Regulations FAQ
Introduction
Introduction
New regulations were announced by CBP in 2017 concerning electronic reporting of In-Bond shipments.
[1]
[1]
[2]
[2]
Currently, carriers with an In-Bond shipment can present a paper 7512 copy of the in-bond to CBP at the destination port, and officers will arrive and/or export the in-bond for the carrier. This "closes" or "cancels" the in-bond out, completing the bonded movement and making sure the carrier doesn't get penalized for an overdue in-bond.

Under the new regulations, carriers will instead be required to electronically report the arrival and export of the in-bond shipment. In-bond port diversions are also required to be reported electronically. BorderConnect's U.S. In-Bond Manager uses CBP's Automated Broker Interface to allow carriers, freight forwarders, U.S. Bonded warehouses, and other affected parties to meet the new electronic reporting requirement.

Notable Changes To The In-Bond Process
Notable Changes To The In-Bond Process
Notable Changes To The In-Bond Process
1. Electronic reporting of in-bond arrival and export is mandatory. CBP will no longer accept a paper 7512 copy of the in-bond to perform arrival and export functionality. Electronic reporting must be conducted through a CBP approved EDI system.
1. Electronic reporting of in-bond arrival and export is mandatory. CBP will no longer accept a paper 7512 copy of the in-bond to perform arrival and export functionality. Electronic reporting must be conducted through a CBP approved EDI system.
2. In-bond arrival or export must be reported within 2 business days of the event.
3. In-bond diversions must also be requested electronically rather than making the request to the CBP port.
4. A FIRMS code is now required in order to report the arrival of the in-bond.
5. Carriers have a standard 30 day maximum transit time for all modes of transport except pipeline and barge traffic.
6. Elimination of the paper 7512 document. (But as there are numerous exceptions to this rule, it is recommended that a paper 7512 still be produced and used as in the past in case it is required.)
Please see the New In-Bond Regulations FAQ at the bottom of this page for further information.

New In-Bond Regulations FAQ
New In-Bond Regulations FAQ
Below are some of the common questions regarding the changes to the in-bond process. 
You can also download a .pdf of the new in-bond requirements here
1. What is changing with the new in-bond regulations on July 29th? What do I have to do differently?
1. What is changing with the new in-bond regulations on July 29th? What do I have to do differently?
The biggest change is that in-bond arrivals and exports must now be reported electronically. Until this point it was possible to report to CBP with a paper copy of the 7512, and a CBP officer would arrive and export the in-bond for you, ΓÇ£closingΓÇ¥ the in-bond. Starting July 29th, 2019, that will no longer be an option. Arrival and export must be reported electronically using a CBP-approved EDI system. In-bond diversions must also be requested electronically.

2. Does this mean I wonΓÇÖt have to stop at the CBP port anymore?
2. Does this mean I wonΓÇÖt have to stop at the CBP port anymore?
ItΓÇÖs possible that you would still need to report in to CBP at the port if the goods in your shipment are regulated by other government departments or CBP policy otherwise requires it. But if the purpose of stopping at the CBP port is only to report the arrival and export of the in-bond, then you would not
need to stop.

3. Whose responsibility is electronic reporting of arrival and export?
3. Whose responsibility is electronic reporting of arrival and export?
The carrier whose bond is obligated on the in-bond shipment is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the in-bond is arrived and, if required, exported. The arrival and export reporting may be done by any authorized agent of the responsible carrier, but the responsibility and liability is still always on the bond holder.

4. What are my options for electronic reporting of in-bond arrival and export?
4. What are my options for electronic reporting of in-bond arrival and export?
There are four options:
There are four options:
Using a CBP-approved QP/WP program. BorderConnectΓÇÖs U.S. In-Bond Manager (ABI In-Bonds) is CBP-approved for this purpose and allows clients to arrive and export their in-bonds.

Contracting an agent to arrive and export in-bonds for you. Anyone with access to a QP/WP system can report in-bond arrival and export on your behalf if they have a letter of authorization from you to do so.

In cases where the in-bond is linked to an ACE eManifest that you have access to, you can use the eManifest to do the electronic reporting. In BorderConnect, these options are available on the shipment details page.

5. IΓÇÖm already arriving and exporting my in-bonds using ACE eManifest. Am I all set?
5. IΓÇÖm already arriving and exporting my in-bonds using ACE eManifest. Am I all set?
That depends. You are meeting your electronic reporting requirements for those in-bonds that youΓÇÖre handling that way. But if you ever pick up in-bond shipments within the U.S., there would be no ACE eManifest for you to use for reporting, so you would need to use one of the other options above instead. You would also need to use another option if another party did the ACE eManifest, since you wouldnΓÇÖt have access to it in that case. We would recommend getting set up for BorderConnectΓÇÖs U.S. In-Bond Manager either way, so that you are set up to handle electronic reporting for any and all cases.

6. What is in-bond arrival? When does it take place, and when is it required to be reported?
6. What is in-bond arrival? When does it take place, and when is it required to be reported?
In-bonds of type 61 (Immediate Transportation) and 62 (Transportation and Exportation) cover the movement of a shipment through the U.S., beginning at an originating port and ending at a destination port. In-Bond arrival takes place when the shipment reaches the destination port. Arrival of the in-bond must be reported to CBP within 2 business days after it has taken place. For an Immediate Transportation in-bond, this completes the in-bond move and ΓÇ£closesΓÇ¥ the in-bond.

7. What is in-bond export? When does it take place, and when is it required to be reported?
7. What is in-bond export? When does it take place, and when is it required to be reported?
In-bonds of type 62 (Transportation and Exportation) and 63 (Immediate Export) cover the movement of a shipment that is destined outside of the U.S. Export of the in-bond takes place when the shipment has physically left the U.S., or when the shipment is located where exportation is reasonably assured. For example at a seaport, airport or rail location and under control of the exporting carrier. Export of the in-bond must be reported to CBP within 2 business days after it has taken place. For in-bonds of type Transportation and Exportation and Immediate Export, this completes the in-bond move and ΓÇ£closesΓÇ¥ the in-bond. Please note that a Transportation and Exportation in-bond must be arrived prior to being exported. (See above.)

8. Can you take me through all of the statuses in the in-bond process?

9. What about the new FIRMS code requirement for arrival reporting? What is a FIRMS code, and how do I know which one to use?
9. What about the new FIRMS code requirement for arrival reporting? What is a FIRMS code, and how do I know which one to use?
The in-bond regulation changes also mandate that a FIRMS code must be included when reporting the arrival of an in-bond. The FIRMS code tells CBP more specifically where the in-bond shipment has arrived. Where the port code tells CBP the general area, the FIRMS code tells them the specific facility the goods have arrived at. The FIRMS code you use must always be associated to the destination port of the in-bond.

Depending on the type of in-bond movement, the FIRMS code you need to use may refer to different types of facilities:

A CBP port facility. This would be used in cases where youΓÇÖre reporting the arrival of an in-bond that has already left the U.S., such as a Transportation and Exportation in-bond that has already crossed into Canada. The appropriate CBP port facility would be that of the port of exit from the U.S.

This would be used in cases where youΓÇÖre reporting the arrival of an in-bond that has already left the U.S., such as a Transportation and Exportation in-bond that has already crossed into Canada. The appropriate CBP port facility would be that of the port of exit from the U.S.
A U.S. bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone. Applicable whenever the in-bond movement covers delivery to one of these two types of facility.

An airport, seaport, or other secure carrier facility.
An airport, seaport, or other secure carrier facility.
BorderConnectΓÇÖs U.S. In-Bond Manager provides several convenience features to make it easier to find the appropriate FIRMS code. FIRMS codes can be selected by name or address when known, or by entering the port code of the destination port to see all FIRMS codes available for that port.

10. A customs broker is setting up my in-bonds for me. DoesnΓÇÖt that mean theyΓÇÖll be handling the arrival and export reporting for me too?
10. A customs broker is setting up my in-bonds for me. DoesnΓÇÖt that mean theyΓÇÖll be handling the arrival and export reporting for me too?
Many customs brokers may offer this as an additional service, but they are not required to do so. You would need to check in with them to determine if itΓÇÖs a service they offer, what rates they charge, and what their requirements are.

11. Another carrier has offered to handle electronic reporting for me. Is that okay?
11. Another carrier has offered to handle electronic reporting for me. Is that okay?
Yes, carriers, freight forwarders, and bonded warehouses may offer to handle electronic reporting for carriers they are doing business with. If they have access to a CBP-approved EDI system and you provide them with a letter of authorization, they can handle reporting for you.

12. Okay, so IΓÇÖm having someone else handle electronic reporting of arrivals and exports for me. Is there any way for me to check their work so that I donΓÇÖt end up with a surprise penalty?
12. Okay, so IΓÇÖm having someone else handle electronic reporting of arrivals and exports for me. Is there any way for me to check their work so that I donΓÇÖt end up with a surprise penalty?
Yes. BorderConnectΓÇÖs U.S. In-Bond Manager offers an in-bond status query feature that allows you to verify the current status of your in-bond with CBP. The status query response would also allow you to verify other details such as the in-bond originating and destination ports, and the quantity. For in-bonds destined to Mexico, it also allows you to verify that a subsequent in-bond has been filed, so that your in-bond is no longer liable.

13. What about in-bond diversions? What are the new requirements there?
13. What about in-bond diversions? What are the new requirements there?
An in-bond diversion occurs when a carrier wants to change the in-bond destination from one port to another. Previously, the carrier could contact the CBP port to request permission to divert the in-bond. These requests must now be done electronically instead. A CBP-approved QP/WP program such as BorderConnectΓÇÖs U.S. In-Bond Manager allows carriers to make these electronic diversion requests.

14. Is it true the paper 7512 copy of the in-bond is being eliminated?
14. Is it true the paper 7512 copy of the in-bond is being eliminated?
The paper 7512 can no longer be presented to CBP to arrive and export an in-bond, and the regulations do include the elimination of the paper 7512. However, there are numerous exceptions to this, including shipments moving by air, the requirements of specific CBP ports, and as part of bonded warehouse and foreign trade zone movements. As such, we recommend continuing to keep a paper 7512 copy with the shipment unless youΓÇÖre able to specifically rule out the possibility that it will be needed at some point in the process.

15. What about the new HTS requirement for Immediate Transportation in-bonds?
15. What about the new HTS requirement for Immediate Transportation in-bonds?
The regulations will require all types of in-bonds to include a six digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number when they are filed, including in-bond types that didnΓÇÖt previously require an HTS number such as Immediate Transportation. (Transportation and Exportation in-bonds have always required HTS.) This
part of the in-bond regulation changes is not yet being enforced though, and currently no date has been set for enforcement.

16. How can I sign up for BorderConnectΓÇÖs U.S. In-Bond Manager?
16. How can I sign up for BorderConnectΓÇÖs U.S. In-Bond Manager?
In order to use our U.S. In-Bond Manager, you will need a filer code issued by CBP. BorderConnect will work with you to create a Letter of Intent to submit to CBP, which will result in you being issued a filer code and being set up to use our system. This process can take several weeks depending on the current volume that CBP is processing. Because of this we recommend you apply as soon as possible.

If you already have a filer code, we can help you work with your CBP Client Rep to set it up to work with

On May 6, 2015 Canada Border Services Agency announced a mandatory transition timeline for highway carriers to comply with ACI eManifest. On July 10, 2015 carriers who do not comply with eManifest requirements may be issued zero-rated penalties (non-monetary) under the CBSAΓÇÖs Administrative Monetary Penalty System (AMPS). And beginning January 10, 2016 carriers who do not comply with eManifest requirements may be issued monetary AMPS penalties.

One Hour Prior Notice
One Hour Prior Notice
Under ACI eManifest regulations highway carriers must ensure that the complete ACI eManifest, including the trip and shipments are on file with CBSA for at least one hour prior to the driver's arrival at the border. Failure to do so could result in refused entry into Canada and/or an AMPS penalty.

ACI Lead Sheet
ACI Lead Sheet
When arriving at the border in Canada, the driver must present an ACI lead sheet to the customs officer. The lead sheet allows the officer to bring up the ACI eManifest in their system.
When arriving at the border in Canada, the driver must present an ACI lead sheet to the customs officer. The lead sheet allows the officer to bring up the ACI eManifest in their system.
The lead sheet must have either:

A barcoded Conveyance Reference Number (aka Trip Number), or
A barcoded Conveyance Reference Number (aka Trip Number), or
A barcoded 
Cargo Control Number
A handwritten Conveyance Reference Number on the lead sheet presented with a separate page with a barcoded Cargo Control Number (e.g. invoice with a PARS sticker)
The officer will stamp the lead sheet only as proof of report, they will no longer stamp individual shipments. The carrier has a responsibility to keep the stamped lead sheet as proof of report.
ACI lead sheets can be 
generated from within BorderConnect

Getting Started
Getting Started
If you have not already done so, the first step is to register for ACI with CBSA. Even if you are already set up for ACI with CBSA's eManifest Portal or another software provider, you will need a separate registration in order to use ACI through BorderConnect. You can generate the registration forms at any time when logged into BorderConnect account under Account and Company. You can also call a BorderConnect representative at any time to have the forms emailed or faxed over to you. 

The next step is create profiles for any drivers, trucks and trailers that may be crossing the border. Please note that if you are also a user of BorderConnect's ACE eManifest software you should not need to enter any additional data as the profiles are shared between the ACE and ACI software. Otherwise, it is recommended that you enter the profile information ahead of time to facilitate creating eManifests. Please refer to the individual sections for instructions on entering and maintaining:

ACE Truck Manifest Modernization
ACE Truck Manifest Modernization
On January 30, 2022 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) began the multi-release deployment of Enhancements to ACE Truck Manifest - Phase 2, also known as ACE Truck Manifest Modernization (TMM). Enhancements to ACE Truck Manifest ΓÇô Phase 2 is focused on enhancing the CBP user interface (UI) for the primary and secondary processing of truck manifests. As part of this deployment, previously relaxed validations in the legacy truck manifest application are now supported in TMM and may result in errors for some trade users. To prepare for the upcoming deployments and avoid potential errors, please review the validations as documented in the Truck Manifest X.12 ΓÇô 309 and EDIFACT CUSCAR EDI implementation guides found at 
ACE Import Manifest Documentation
Implementing the capabilities developed in Phase 2, deployment of Phase 3 enhancements will provide trade users with new messaging regarding modifications to Crew, Vehicle, Cargo and Seals. The Phase 3 deployment was set for July 11, 2022. More information on Phase 3 enhancements is available in the ACE Truck Manifest: Draft Chapters for Future Use implementation guides found on 
CBP.gov
ACE Manifest Requirements
ACE Manifest Requirements
Under ACE Manifest regulations trucks must ensure that BOTH the ACE Manifest and the entry number by the customs broker (for PAPS shipments) are on file with CBP for at least one hour prior to the driver's arrival at the border. Failure to do so could result in delays at the border, refused entry into the U.S. and/or penalty action. Users can also process and submit an ACE Manifest up to 30 days in advance of the driver crossing the U.S. Port of Entry.

When arriving at the border in the United States, the driver must present customs paperwork (ie customs invoice and/or Bill of Lading) with a legible trip number or shipment control number. Although CBP officers capture the trip information from the truck license plate, a PAPS barcode and/or barcoded ACE lead sheet can expedite the border processing time and also helps the officer to bring up the ACE Manifest in their system.

The officer will then verify the information is correct, and it is their discretion to move the driver to secondary inspection or not for further verification. CBP officers do not stamp paperwork upon release of the shipment, and the only way to prove that a shipment was released with CBP is to use a signed proof of delivery document.

ACE Manifest lead sheets can be generated from within BorderConnect, either from the manifest or as a set ahead of time. The carrier can also design and produce their own lead sheets.

Getting Started
Getting Started
The first step is create profiles for any drivers, trucks and trailers that may be crossing the border. The information in these profiles will be used to complete mandatory fields on your manifests. It is recommended that you enter the profile information ahead of time to facilitate creating eManifests. Please refer to the individual sections for instructions on entering and maintaining:

Driver profiles

Once you are registered to use ACE with BorderConnect and you have created the driver, truck and trailer profiles, you are ready to begin creating and submitting eManifests to Customs!
